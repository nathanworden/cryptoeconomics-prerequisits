## Introduction

Javascript is a prototype-based language. Every object in Javascript has a hidden internal property called `[[Prototype]]` that can be used to extend object properties and methods.

Until recently, industrious developers used consturtor functions to mimic an object-oriented design pattern in JavaScript. 

### Classes are functions

A Javascript class is a type of function. Classes are declared with the `class` keyword. We will use function expression syntax to initialize a function and class expression syntax to initialze a class.

We know a constructor function is meant to be an object blueprint by the capitalization of the first letter of the initializer (which is optional) and through familiarity with the syntax.

### Definint Methods

The common practice with constructor functions is to assign methods directly to the `prototype`, instead of in the initialization, as seen in the `greet()` method below.

``` javascript
function Hero(name, level) {
  this.name = name
  this.level = level
}

// Adding a method to the construtor
Hero.prototype.greet = function() {
  return `${this.name} says hello.`
}
```

With classes this syntax is simplified, and the method can be added directly to the class. Using the method definition shorthand introduced in ES6, defning a method is an even more concise process.

```javascript
class Hero {
  constructor(name, level) {
    this.name = name
    this.level = level
  }
  
  // Adding a method to the constructor
  greet() {
    return `${this.name} says hello.`
  }
}
```
