## Introduction

Javascript is a prototype-based language. Every object in Javascript has a hidden internal property called `[[Prototype]]` that can be used to extend object properties and methods.

Until recently, industrious developers used consturtor functions to mimic an object-oriented design pattern in JavaScript. 

### Classes are functions

A Javascript class is a type of function. Classes are declared with the `class` keyword. We will use function expression syntax to initialize a function and class expression syntax to initialze a class.

We know a constructor function is meant to be an object blueprint by the capitalization of the first letter of the initializer (which is optional) and through familiarity with the syntax.

### Definint Methods

The common practice with constructor functions is to assign methods directly to the `prototype`, instead of in the initialization, as seen in the `greet()` method below.

``` javascript
function Hero(name, level) {
  this.name = name
  this.level = level
}

// Adding a method to the construtor
Hero.prototype.greet = function() {
  return `${this.name} says hello.`
}
```

With classes this syntax is simplified, and the method can be added directly to the class. Using the method definition shorthand introduced in ES6, defning a method is an even more concise process.

```javascript
class Hero {
  constructor(name, level) {
    this.name = name
    this.level = level
  }
  
  // Adding a method to the constructor
  greet() {
    return `${this.name} says hello.`
  }
}
```



```javascript
const hero1 = new Hero('Varg', 1)
```

### Extending a Class

An advantageous feature of constructor functions and classes is that they can be extended into new object blueprints based off the parent. This prevents repetition of code for objects that are similar but need some additional or more specific features.

New constructor functions can be created from the parent using the call method. In the example below, we will create a more specific character class called `Mage`, and assign the properties of `Hero` to it using `call()`, as well as adding an additinoal property.

We will also set the `Mage's` prototype to the one of `Hero`. Thus, `Mage` will inherit the methods of the `Hero`'s prototype.

```javascript
// Creating a new constructor from the parent
function Mage(name, level, spell) {
  // Chain constructor with call
  Hero.call(this, name, level)
  
  this.spell = spell
}

// Creating a new object using Hero's prototype as the prototype for the newly created object.
Mage.protogype = Object.create(Hero.prototype)
```

Now we can create a new instance of `Mage` using the same properties as `Hero` as well as a new one we added.

```javascript
const hero2 = new Mage('Lejon', 2, 'Magic Missle')
```

 With ES6 classes, the `super` keyword is used in place of `call` to access the parent functions.

We will use `extends` to refer to the parent class.

```javascript
//Creating a new class from the parent
class Mage extends Hero {
  constructor(name, level, spell) {
    // Chain constructor with super
    super(name, level)
    
    // Add a new property
    this.spell = spell
  }
}
```

Now we can create a new `Mage` instance in the same manner.

```javascript
const hero2 = new Mage('Lejon', 2, 'Magic Missile')
```

Belo is a side-by-side comparison of the entire process of initialization, adding methods, and inheritance of a constructor function and a class.

```javascript
function Hero(name, level) {
  this.name = name
  this.level = level
}

// Adding a method to the constructor
Hero.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `${this.name} says hello.`
}

// Creating a new constructor from the parent 
function Mage(name, level, spell) {
  // Chain constructor with call
  Hero.call(this, name, level)
  
  this.spell = spell
}

// Creating a new object using Hero's prototype as the prototype for the newly created object.
Mage.prototype = Object.create(Hero.prototype)
```



```javascript
// Initializing a class
class Hero {
  constructor(name, level) {
    this.name = name
    this.level = level
  }
  
  // Adding a method to the constructor
  greet() {
    return `${this.name} says hello.`
  }
}

// Creating a new class from the parent
class Mage extends Hero {
  constructor(name, level, spell) {
    // Chain constructor with super
    super(name, level)
    
    // Add a new property
    this.spell = spell
  }
}
```
